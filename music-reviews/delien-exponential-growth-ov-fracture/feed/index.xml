In DeLIEN&#039;s case, a lot of the freshness comes from 1) They&#039;re really good at mixing down and 2) Their sound and composition style was unique enough (despite being somewhat categorical) to make them still sound like they&#039;re pushing new boundaries. I&#039;m eager to hear what they do when given the chance to work on new material again.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Wow, I haven&#039;t listened to this kind of Industrial in a long time. But what I have been listening to is Breakcore. I think extreme electronic music has looped back around and is biting it&#039;s own tail. Not that I&#039;m saying that there&#039;s nothing new or interesting but it&#039;s curious that something created over a decade ago can sound so fresh and new. It also has a Meat Beat Manifesto vibe, which I also like. Cool stuff.]]></description>
