										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Founded in 2010 by Jake Murray, in violet is a musical project marrying the worlds of the experimental with the conventional. Traversing all manner of sonic terrain, from abrasive post-industrial structures to spacial lysergic landscapes, the concept is one of momentum and exploration. Initially a recording project, in violet has evolved over the years and the songs reimagined for live performances to reinterpret what was once familiar. With a carousel of contributors and co-writers across all releases to date, in violet continues push the envelope of just how far one wild idea can go. </p>

<p>In the early 1990&#8217;s, some of the most exciting electronic sounds were coming from the demoscene, which had its own unique culture of downloading and sharing music. The songs were designed to be coupled with graphics demos, but many of them took on a decoupled life of their own long after the demo itself had been forgotten.</p>



<p>That was when B.T. Franklin started writing music on his computer.</p>



<p>&#8220;There was a lot of really inspiring electronic music coming out of that movement,&#8221; says B.T. &#8220;One of the greatest things about it was that you could download the songs and then look into them, modify them, take the instrument samples out and use them in your own songs.&#8221;</p>



<p>Today, the tools are different and much more powerful, but B.T. still loves the sound and spirit of those demoscene days. &#8220;I&#8217;m sure anybody who listened to that stuff back then would instantly hear the influence in my newer compositions, but I&#8217;m also trying to evolve my sound all the time, so it&#8217;s not just a throwback that&#8217;s stuck in the past.&#8221;</p>

<p>Max Greening&#8217;s life has grown from childhood with music as a basic ingredient. Beginning as your average kid with an acoustic guitar, Max&#8217;s skills developed and he started composing. Fatefully, his discovery of electronic music coincided with his stumbling into video editing. Realizing the expanded possibilities, Max&#8217;s path diverged and developed into an obsession for this art of soundscaping. Taking instruction from Vancouver Film School&#8217;s Sound Design Program combined with the study of other electronic artists, Max has developed his craft into the pursuit of perfection, into the conveyance of his being through guitar and electronics in the form of ambient music.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Daniel Tuttle has been active in music promotion and publishing since 1994. Beginning as an experiment, he joined a local musician to create “computer music”, which turned into an industrial band, Ogun’s Will. Since then, he have been involved in numerous bands, and designed album covers for even more. Daniel has been instrumental in organizing more than a few massive underground music events and festivals, including a stage at the Detroit Electronic Music Festival in 2003 and 2004. For the past ten years, Daniel has been running Bottle Imp Productions, a DIY online record label I put together to help new and obscure artists broaden their reach globally utilizing social media and modern age strategies to marketing music in a post-Napster world.</p>
<p>Since 1994, I have created and released music on over a dozen albums under a few different project titles, as can be seen in my Discography.</p>
<p>In addition to releasing music, Daniel also DJs from time to time. He has spun ambient and classical mixes every year at the DAMNED Show in Detroit, as well as spinning the Steampunk event at Disctrict VII, also in Detroit. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Row Boat is a post-rock solo project by Mark Wardale. Mark cites several Scandinavian influences behind Row Boat, including classical Nordic sounds and current musical acts such as Sigur Ros, Bjork and Surferosa. Mark describes Row Boat as, “an effort to depict the nature of Scandinavia in note form.” The result is a lush, alternative-rock, ethereal ambience created from a merging of organic strings and horns in an electronic medium.</p>
<p>Row Boat’s first release was the 2009 ambient E.P. “Romance.” A second E.P., “Svaret är Ja,” (The Answer is Yes) was released in 2012. 2013 witnessed the release of Row Boat’s first full length album, “E.T.T.”</p>
